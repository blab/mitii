# Description

**Short course taught by [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org/) and [Trevor Bedford](http://bedford.io/) for [MITII 2017 Summer School on Modeling Immunology](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/mitii/summer-school/).**

An introduction to immunity from an evolutionary perspective. We will introduce basic notions of molecular evolution, phylogenetics, and evolutionary models which will set the foundation for modeling pathogens and antibody-making B cells. We will additionally introduce multistrain compartmental models and introduce the diversity generating mechanisms of B and T cells, and survey repertoire analysis.
